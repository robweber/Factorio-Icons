# Factorio Icons Processing Repository

Welcome to the **Factorio Icons Repository**! This repository hosts scripts to extract and process the icons used in the [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/) game and its [Space Age](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/space-age-released) DLC.

## Features
- **Automated Icon Processing**: Leverage Python scripts to collect, create variations, crop, upscale, and combine icons effortlessly.
- **Customization**: Tailor icons to your project's specific needs with easy-to-use processing tools.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
3. **Install Dependencies**

Ensure you have Python installed. Install necessary Python packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
This repository includes five Python scripts, each serving a specific purpose in managing and processing icons.

### Scripts

#### `collect.py`

**Description**:  
This script searches for PNG images within a specified directory and its subdirectories.
It copies images that match target sizes to a designated destination folder, ensuring no
filename conflicts by generating unique filenames when necessary.

**Example:** `python collect.py -p "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Factorio/data" -d icons/

**Arguments**:

```
  -p, --icon_path ICON_PATH
                        Path to Factorio icons, if using Steam this is Steam/steamapps/common/Factorio/data
  -d, --destination_folder DESTINATION_FOLDER
                        Folder where icons will be copied to
```

---

#### `create_barrels.py`

**Description**:  
This script generates barrel icons for various fluids in a game or application using the Python Imaging
Library (PIL). It creates composite icons for filled and empty barrels based on fluid colors.

**Example:** `python create_barrels.py -p icons/cropped -o icons/output

**Arguments:**

```
  -p, --icon_root_path ICON_ROOT_PATH
                        Path to root icon folder that has barrel mask files
  -o, --output_folder OUTPUT_FOLDER
                        Folder where icons will be created
```

---

#### `crop.py`

**Description**:  
This module provides functionality to process PNG images by cropping them into specified parts based on their
dimensions. It is designed to handle images with specific width-to-height ratios, supporting both 2-part and
4-part cropping modes.

**Example:** `python crop.py -i icons/120x64 -o icons/cropped -p 1

**Arguments:**

```
  -i, --input_folder INPUT_FOLDER
                        Path to the folder containing input images.
  -o, --output_folder OUTPUT_FOLDER
                        Path to the folder where processed images will be saved.
  -p, --part PART       The part to crop. For 4-part images, valid values are 1-4. For 2-part images, valid values are 1-2. Defaults to 1.
```

---

#### `upscale.py`

**Description**:  
This module provides functions to rescale images from a specified size to a target size.
It supports processing individual image files or entire folders containing images.

**Example:** `python upscale.py -i path/to/image1.png -o output.png -s 100 100

**Arguments:**

```
  -i, --input_path INPUT_PATH
                        Input a file or folder of icon files
  -o, --output_path OUTPUT_PATH
                        Output folder for upscaled images
  -s, --scale SCALE SCALE
                        The size to scale the images, width and height
```

---

#### `combine.py`

**Description**:  
This script provides functionality to overlay multiple images with optional downscaling.
It uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to manipulate images and combine them into a single output.

**Example:** `python combine.py -i path/to/image1.png /path/to/image2.png -o output.png

**Arguments:**

```
  -i, --images IMAGES [IMAGES ...]
                        Path to the images to combine, should be more than one
  -d, --downscale [DOWNSCALE ...]
                        Downscaling factor (1, .5, etc). If used it must match the number of images - 1
  -o, --output_file OUTPUT_FILE
                        Path to file where final combined images is stored
```
